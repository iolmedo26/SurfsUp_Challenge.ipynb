# surfs_up
To begin this challenge, the following were needed: 
   Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis, and climate database, SQLAlchemy, ORM queries, Pandas and Matplotlib. 
   Used jupyter notebook and hawaii.sqlite 
    The purpose of this challenge was to determine specifically and achieve a summary of temperature data for the months of June and December. 
    The data gatherered was to determine if a prospective surf and ice cream shop business can sustainably operate year-round as opposed to a seasonal business, during peak tourism. 
    In my opinion I would advice that even though temperatures recorded in December seem to vary more than those of June, December would still provide appropriate weather conditions for both surfing and demand in ice cream. 
	 The average temperatures in June and December only differ by 4 degrees, which by looking at the December histogram, I am more confident it is appropriate. Decembe 's median temperature, with the highest frequency recorded across a span of years, is about 72 degrees, at least double the frequency of the next highest recorded average temperatures of 75 and 67. 
    Some of the differences I did discover during my findings is that between the month of June and December, there was a significant difference of people "sunbathing vs surfing" and that could definitely be related to the temperature of the water overall.
